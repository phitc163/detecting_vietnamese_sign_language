Detecting Vietnamese Sign Language (VSL) refers to the use of technology to recognize and understand the hand gestures used in Vietnamese Sign Language. This is an active area of research with the goal of improving communication between deaf and hearing individuals.

Here's how VSL detection works:

Capturing the Signs:  Systems typically use cameras to capture video of a person signing.

Identifying Hand Features:  Software extracts information about the hand's position, movement, and shape from the video.

Understanding the Signs:  Machine learning algorithms analyze the extracted features to recognize the signs being used.
